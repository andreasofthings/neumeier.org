It seems [23andme lost significant amounts of data](https://therecord.media/scraping-incident-genetic-testing-site) recently. If you did ever send your genes there, consider yourself stupid.

Also, #TIL 'DAU' is short for 'Daily active user', in certain circles of #product #management. For a felt eternity, the acronym was coined very differently. At least in my bubble.
