Meredith Whittaker's recent onstage appearance at TechCrunch 2023 was a timely and important reminder of the importance of privacy and encryption in the digital age.

Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, spoke about the company's commitment to protecting user data and advocating for end-to-end encrypted messaging. She also discussed the dangers to privacy of artificial intelligence, that fundamentally is surveillance technology.

Whittaker's message is clear: we need to be vigilant in defending our privacy and our right to communicate securely. Signal is one tool that can help us do that, but it is important to remember that there is no single solution to the problem of surveillance. We need to work together to create a more privacy-focused digital world.
